  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a full-stack developer with experience building, deploying, and maintaining web applications
    that are functional, reliable, and scalable. I work across the full development lifecycle, from
    planning and design to implementation and ongoing improvement, which gives me a strong understanding
    of how modern web applications are put together.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the front end, I focus on creating responsive, accessible, and intuitive user interfaces that
    provide a smooth experience for users. On the back end, I build and manage server-side logic,
    handle data storage and retrieval, and integrate APIs and services that support secure and efficient
    application performance. I place a strong emphasis on clean structure, maintainable code, and
    long-term scalability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I approach development with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to continuous learning.
    By working on real-world projects and staying current with best practices, I aim to build solutions
    that solve real problems and deliver lasting value. My goal is to create software that is dependable,
    easy to maintain, and aligned with both user needs and business objectives.
